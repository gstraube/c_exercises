**Objective:** Further practice of array manipulation, this time with
a bit more complicated case.

Write function `void sort(int *start, int size)` that sorts the
integers in the given array into an ascending order (from smallest to
largest). You can use the selection sort algorithm: first find the
smallest number in array, and swap it with the first element of the
array. Then do the same starting from the second element of the array,
moving on to third, fourth, etc. until the whole array is
processed. Test the function with different arrays of different size.
