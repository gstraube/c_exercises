**Objective:** Practice use of dynamic memory allocation with integer arrays

Implement function **dyn_reader** that allocates an *int* array for
*n* integers. *n* is given as argument to the function when it is
called. After allocating the array, the function should read the given
number of integers to the array from user, using the *scanf*
function. After the right amount of integers have been read, the
function returns pointer to the dynamically allocated array.
