**Objective:** Practice use of *realloc* together with array
  manipulation.

Implement function **add_to_array** that adds a single integer to the
existing dynamically allocated array of integers (*arr*). The length
of the existing array is *num*, and the new integer to be added is
given in parameter *newval*. You'll need to ensure that array is
extended to hold the additional integer. Check that the function works
correctly when called several consecutive times.
