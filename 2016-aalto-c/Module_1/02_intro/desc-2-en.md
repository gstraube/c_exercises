title: Fix the types
task_id: 02-intro-2
points: 1


**Objective:** Get first touch on proper use of basic data types in C.

The exercise template contains function *fix_types*, that makes three
calculations and outputs the results. The purpose would be to print
the first result at a precision of one decimal, and the later two
result as integers. Unfortunately the function outputs incorrect
results.

Fix the function in such way that it prints correct results. The
expected output is:

`5.3  8000000  66666`

Do not touch the *printf* line, but correct the data types defined for
the variables in the function.
