title: Sum
task_id: 05-calc-1
points: 1


**Objective:** practice use of formatted input and output.

Write function `void simple_sum(void)` that asks two integers from the
user, calculates their sum, and prints the result in the following
format: `1 + 2 = 3`. There should be a newline ('\n') in the end. For
example (user input is shown as red, program output is shown as
black):

<pre>
<font color="red">4 5</font>
4 + 5 = 9</pre>

**Hint:** Because scanf function ignores the whitespace characters,
you can accept inputs that involve, for example, a newline or
multiple spaces between the two numbers.
